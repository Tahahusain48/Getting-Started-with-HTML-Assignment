<!-- Q2-Explain the purpose  of comments in HTML and provide an example of  how to use  comments in an HTML -->
When we comment a line it will not render the line or the content is not rendered in the browser.
And another use of commenting is to add an explanation or note to the code.
If we want to comment a line in html we simply put the content inside <!--  content   -->
  <!-- <h1>Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit. Dolores, non</h1> -->
